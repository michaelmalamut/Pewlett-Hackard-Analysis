# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis
## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to build a database to find out who will be retiring and how many people will Pewlett-Hackard need to hire after the individuals that retire are no longer with the company in order to complete the employee research. In addition, I will be generating lists to find out who will be eligible for the retirement package.
